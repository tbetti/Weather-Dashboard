<h2>Description</h2>
When users input a city name, this app uses the OpenWeather API to display current and forecasted weather results for the city.  Each search the user makes is recorded as a button so the weather for recently searched cities can be easily accessed again.

<h2>How to Use</h2>
<p>Type the name of a city in the box and click "Search" or click a city button saved from a previous search.  The current weather conditions for the city will display first listing the temperature (F), windspeed (MPH), humidity, and UV Index. Underneath the current weather is the five-day forecast for this searched city which lists temperature, windspeed, and humidity for each of the next five days.</p>
<p>Clear list of previously-searched cities by clicking the "Clear Cities" button.</p>
